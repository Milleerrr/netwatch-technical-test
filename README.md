# Objective
The goal of this challenge is to give you a chance to showcase your coding style and how you structure your work. Don't worry about making it perfect or fully polishedâ€”it's more about getting a feel for how you solve problems and build out features.

Create a simple application using **Laravel** that provides a list of TV shows and movies. The application should have a simplistic but modern front-end template built with **Vue.js**, featuring separate pages for TV shows and movies.
